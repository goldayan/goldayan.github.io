** Hellooo, Tinkerers!

This is Thanga Ayyanar A @ Gold Ayan

I am a versatile polyglot programmer with extensive experience across
multiple programming languages. Sometimes, I will deliver a talk at
*Kanchilug* or participating in a conference in and around
Chennai, where I share my insights and knowledge with fellow tech
enthusiasts. In addition to my speaking engagements, I am passionate
about promoting open-source software and actively translate
open-source books into Tamil, making valuable resources accessible to
a wider audience.

My favorite tools include **Linux**, **Emacs**, and **Scheme/Lisp**. I
am also an active member of the Tamil Linux Community, where I
contribute to discussions and share knowledge. You can often find me
engaging with the community at [[https://forums.tamillinuxcommunity.org][Tamil Linux Community]]

Additionally, I encourage you to explore the *Tamil tech event
Website*, which lists various upcoming events in the region. You can
view the website [[https://tamilnadu.tech][here]]. This resource is a great way to stay informed
about the latest happenings in the Tamil tech community.

Sometimes i write blog in Tamil language at [[https://kaniyam.com][kaniyam.com]]
