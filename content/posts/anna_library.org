This was my first time visiting the library, and it is impressive with
its **8 floors** (plus a ground floor). The process is very simple:
you don't need to pay any fees. Just drop your bag at the nearby
counter (free of charge). You are allowed to carry a notebook and a
water bottle inside. To enter, you just need to sign in—either in a
physical register or online.

If you bring a **laptop**, there is a separate sign-in process for
security when entering and exiting. Each floor is divided into two
sections: **Section A (அ)** and **Section B (ஆ)**.
*** Floor 1

I spent about 30–45 minutes here. **Section A** houses newspapers and
magazines, while **Section B** is dedicated to children's books. I
found several tech and science magazines particularly interesting,
including:

| Number | Magazine Name     |
|--------+-------------------|
|     44 | Tamil Computer    |
|    112 | Data quest        |
|    113 | Digit             |
|    114 | Down to earth     |
|    117 | Electronics for u |
|    146 | PC Quest          |
|    154 | Stuff             |
|    184 | The book review   |

I started with the December 1st edition of *Tamil Computer*. It
featured fascinating articles on the importance of savings, Linux apps
on Pixel, using the Linux terminal on Android, the benefits of
websites, and how LLMs (Large Language Models) work. I even spotted
articles by my friends: one on **Spell Checkers** by Kaniyam Shrini
and another on **USB Workings** by Kaleeshwar. It reminded me of a
conversation I had with Shrini last year about open-source
spell-checking tools.

*** Floor 3 section A 
Here i explored computer book specially and found quite a lot of interesting books.
- Domain Driven Design
I found books from following publication
- OReilly
- APress
- Head First books (WOW)
- dummies series (eg: Network for Dummies)
- BPB publication

I spent most of my time reading *Implementing NLP Use Cases Using
BERT*. My interest in this was sparked by AI/ML engineers I've met at
conferences and meetups who recommended studying **BERT**
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

*** Floor 5 section A
Next, I explored the Mathematics section. Two books stood out:
- Business calculus DeMystified
- Make: Calculus
  - This one is amazing! It teaches calculus using **OpenSCAD** (3D
    modeling software), which is a very unique approach. I’ll
    definitely be coming back for this one.

*** Final Thoughts
  My only regret was **not bringing my laptop**. While the library is a
bit of a long commute for me, it is absolutely worth the trip. If you
are in or around Chennai, you should definitely check it out!
