Network isolation for vulnerable devices in home

** Smart TV
- I my case it uses intranet to stream video and cast video from phone.
- I can assign static ip address to smart tv and Access Control / Parental Controls: Create a rule to Block Internet Access for that specific IP.
  - I tried Parental controls to disable internet for a particular device but it also cann't access intranet.
- I can allow when needed to install app or stream something in it.

** IOT devices
- Enable guest network
- The Isolation: In your router settings, look for a checkbox that says "Allow guests to see each other" or "Access Intranet/Local Network." Make sure these are OFF.
- If you consume only content from internet for TV use this network.
- If you use DIY IOT devices and use local api then connect it to the main wifi access point

** Homelab server
- Assign static ip address based on Mac
- For ease of use, you can assosiate free duckdns domain to it.
- Why ? Getting SSL certificates for local server it pretty easy this way
- I have personally tried caddy, i have seen people did it using ngnix proxy manager.
- If you want to secure further, you can access it through tailscale and map the tailscale ip to the duckdns domain.

** Personal devices
- Your phone, laptops are connected to normal wifi access point
- Your phone cann't access IOT devices (i haven't verified it yet)

** Changelog
- <2026-01-10 Sat> added few points in all sections.
