I use flatpak to install floorp

#+begin_src shell
  flatpak install flathub one.ablaze.floorp
#+end_src

Gone with Lepton custom theme as i need to customize the UI little bit.

Disabled the following
- Tabs
- Side bar heading
- removed few unnecessary menu items in the menu bar

Addons
- Firefox containers
- Container Tabs Sidebar
  - I usually prefar sidebery plugin but i want something minimalistic the website restore on startup
- ublock origin

Installing web progressive app can be done once it is enabled in the
settings

but when progressive app is open the Floorp instance with existing
session is also opened if it is not opened already which is annoying

Other than that it is great no need to dabble with chrome.css to
change UI (atleast for me, as my requirement is basic which comes with
browser options itself)

My browser needs are satisfied by
- librewolf
- floorp (sometimes)
- chrome (If above two won't work as expected)
