This year, I got an opportunity to be a volunteer at the JSLover conference
which helped me a lot for TOSSConf 2025 preparation, as well as last
year SFD(Software Freedom Day) 2024 event.
</p>

<p>
KanchiLug volunteers, Pailagam Institute and St.joseph students are
The reasons we can successfully hold this conference with great
success.
</p>

<p>
<del>I</del> We implemented a lot of things at the conference
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two separate tracks for both the Workshop and talks</li>
<li>Stalls</li>
<li>Dhuruvangal book for speakers</li>
<li>A5 Stickers sheet (stole the idea from JSLover conference)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each of the above tasks comes with its own set of issues, but with
Volunteers, we can finalise the details before the conference starts.

<div id="outline-container-org7516584" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7516584">Pros</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7516584">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Met a lot of old and new friends at this conference.</li>
<li>Stickers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we decided which sticker to print so got firefox, vlc, blender, ..</li>
<li>Also tons of sticker from stalls but not able to get few.</li>
<li>My laptop has no room for stickers now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Got my own hard copy of the book Dhuruvangal.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gave my copy to my college friend to read.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invited my brothers for this event, they too enjoyed the event.</li>
<li>Conducted Selfhosting workshop with salman over a huge crowd (I never did that before :p).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Conducting workshop with more than one member helps us identify and address the issue properly.</li>
<li>So next time i am doing workshop i plan on doing it with more people.</li>
<li>It also help us with crowd control and resolve their problems quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org886c9d0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org886c9d0">Cons</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org886c9d0">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not able to attend few talks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As i was handling one of the track i am not able to listen to talks that are happening in other track.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only had a few time to roam around the stall so i took bunch of photo but not able to talk to lot of them.</li>
<li>Day 2 was more tough, i missed meeting few people who came to the conference.</li>
<li>I felt the crowd control was bit off now and then but worked out in the end.</li>
<li>Sometimes we felt we have fewer volunteers, especially during lunch.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall i learned a lot and i am honoured that i get to take part in
Tamil Nadu's only Tamil based Open Source conferenece.
